The purpose of this code is to analyze thousands of stocks over the course of three years (2014-2016). Within the analysis, the code compiles a summary of the stocks, aggregating all the data that pertains to each stock. 

•	The data is summarized from daily data to yearly. First the code calculates the change in price based on the opening price of the stock and the beginning of the year and subtracts the closing price of the stock at the end of the year. 

•	Then the code calculates the percentage change of each stock with the yearly change compared to the stock’s opening price on day 1. 

•	Lastly, the code calculates the aggregate trading volume of each stock over the course of the year by adding the daily volume.
